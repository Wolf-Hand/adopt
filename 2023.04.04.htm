    <h1 style="font-size: 300%">April 4, 2023</h1>
    <h1 style="font-size: 200%; padding: 0px">A Non-Exhaustive List of Thank Yous</h1>
    
    <ul>
      <li>First of all, thank you to all of YOU for following along on our adoption journey! Thank you for donating, buying soap and shirts, praying, loving us, and so much more! It means more than we can say that people all over the world were thinking about us, praying for us, and keeping the faith that our perfect little one would find us.</li>
      <li>Thank you to our parents and families for being supportive of us in our decision to adopt! (and for loving Judah so, so well!)</li>
      <li>Thank you to our church family at Central CoC in Vincennes who loved and supported us throughout this entire process! We would not have made it very far without your support!</li>
      <li>Also, thanks to our church family at MCCoC in Mt. Carmel! You will always be family to me. We know your excitement and prayers have been with us the whole way and we are so thankful for that.</li>
      <li>A BIG thank you to the church family we met at Central Kitsap CoC in Washington! You will always have a special place in our hearts! We feel strongly that God put you all in our path exactly when we needed you most! Thank you for welcoming and loving a weird girl from Indiana who showed up to your Wednesday night meal and song service. &#128521; Special thanks to: Dani, Toni, and Julianna!</li>
      <li>We can&#39;t say enough Thank Yous to the Special Care Nursery nurses, social workers, volunteers, and staff at St. Michael&#39;s in Silverdale, WA! We are particularly thankful for the love and care you gave to Judah when we were unable to be with him during that first week and a half of his life. And we are thankful for the love and care you continued to show to him and us throughout our stay in the hospital! Special thanks to: Kylie, Darlene, Morgan, Chrysti, Stefanie, Rebecca, Lisa, Tracy, Jazz, Michell, Tiffany, Keely, Lynn, and Julie!</li>
      <li>Thank you to my work family! You know how to make a girl feel appreciated! &#128522; Meals, snacks, presents, you name it! I know my being out for an extended amount of time makes for a bit of chaos for you! You are handling it with grace, and I am so thankful to you all for allowing me to have this time with my sweet Judah. *Shout out to Madi and Allie for being the real MVPs!*</li>
      <li>We want to be sure to thank legal and adoption professionals who have touched our lives along the way! The judge for Judah&#39;s initial case, the guardian ad litem, all the attorneys, countless social workers, Faithful Adoption Consultants, Greater Love Adoption Decision, Connected by Love Adoptions, and more I am sure I&#39;m forgetting! Special thanks to: Heather, Meg, Jana, Janine, and Kyla.</li>
      <li>Perhaps most of all we are so thankful to Judah&#39;s first mother for loving him and choosing us to be his parents! Please join us in continuing to pray for his first mother! We hope she feels supported, loved, and at peace with her decision in the coming months and years.</li>
    </ul>
