    <p>
      We have officially contracted with Faithful Adoption Consultants (FAC) to assist us in our adoption process! We are so excited to have taken this first step! Next up: home study, family book, and fundraising!
    </p>
    <p>
      FAC will help us connect to a local home study agency so we can get our home study done quickly, ethically, and correctly. This process should take approximately 3 months.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we&#39;re working on the home study, we will also be working on our family book. A family book is a book of essays and pictures to help the birth mother reading it get a sense of who we are and what kind of life their child would have if they chose us as their family. FAC is helping us with creating this book and we are grateful for the guidance!
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, we have started fundraising in earnest! Our goal is $40,000.
    </p>
    <ol style="font-family: swansea-font; color: #013328; font-size: 175%;">
      <li>Lydia is selling homemade soaps, lotion bars, and bath bombs to raise money for our adoption. If you are interested in purchasing any of these products, please reach out and let us know! You can email us at <a href="mailto:contact@wrightadoption.com">contact@wrightadoption.com</a>.</li>
      <li>We are planning to launch a t-shirt fundraiser soon! When we are ready to start that, we will let everyone know via social media and this website. Be on the lookout!</li>
      <li>We are selling puzzle pieces! Each piece will be $10, and you can purchase as many as you like! When you purchase one, we will write your name on the back of the puzzle piece. Once all of the puzzle pieces have been purchased, we will assemble the puzzle and place it in a two-way glass frame to be hung in our child&#39;s nursery. We want to be sure to let our baby know that we have a village of people who helped us bring them home.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      We are so excited to be adopting and we feel honored to be able to bring you all along on the journey with us. We appreciate your prayers, love, and support more that we could ever express.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blessings to you all!
    </p>
