    <h1 style="font-size: 300%">What Are We Doing?</h1>
    <p>
      We always knew that we would follow a less-than-traditional path to grow our family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben and I have known each other our whole lives. We started dating at the end of 2015 and things quickly became serious. By March of 2016 we were engaged, and on December 17, 2016 we were married. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We started bringing children into our home through foster care in December of 2018 and had children in our home consistently until September 2020. We love each and every child that has spent time in our home, but it became clear that our hearts longed for something permanent. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to take on the primary responsibility of helping a child grow throughout their life. We want to teach them the gospel and watch their understanding of God grow as they age. We want to help them discover their hobbies and cultivate their talents. We want to teach them about relationships and healthy boundaries; then watch them implement those in adulthood. We want to be there with them through all the successes and heartaches that life may throw at them. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, we are seeking to adopt, because we believe that love begets love. We want to show as much love as we can while we're here on Earth. In our minds, there is no better way to show/spread this love than through adoption.
